# Ghouls: Revenge

It's been 40 years since the deadly haunted mansion. What horrors has
the ghost been cooking up? Now, revisit the mansion - and 14 exciting
new 4-level situations. (But beware! Wherever your adventures take
you, the ghost is never far behind!)



Once the ghost is defeated, take on his mantle yourself, and devise
fresh torments.

# Running the game

The game comes as a zip file containing disk images suitable for use
with an emulator, Gotek, or for writing to floppy disk.

There are 2 DFS disk images, for BBC B/B+/Master/Compact:

There are 3 ADFS disk images, for BBC Master/Compact: (apologies, but
BBC B/B+ ADFS is not supported)

All disk images are auto-booting. Just press SHIFT+BREAK. The title
screen will appear. Press any key for the menu, then select the option
of interest: (these are discussed below)

- `1` - play the game
- `2` - run the level editor
- `3` - run a debug version of the game with some additional cheats
  for testing your levels.
  
(If you know which entry you want, you can press it at the title
screen and save a keypress. Also: press `V` at the menu to report the
build version number.)

# Game

Select the level set you want from the menu. Jump to a specific set
quickly by pressing its shortcut key, shown in the bottom right as you
screll through.

Select the game mode on startup:

- `1` - Classic: 4 lives, game ends if you run out
- `2` - Infinite Lives: as many deaths as you want, but the game
  ends if the bonus timer falls to 0. The bonus timer is reset on each
  new level
- `3` - Time Attack: get through each level as quickly as you can!
  The best score is recorded

There are in-game instructions giving a brief overview of how to play,
and the keys to use.

# Level editor

The level editor has its own page: 

# Debug game

Mostly as the ordinary game, with a few differences:

- The `ON ERROR` routine prints the error encountered, and ESCAPE
  isn't trapped
- In Classic or Infinite Lives mode, when asking if you want to see
  game objects, you can press one of the following keys:
  
  - `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` - start on that level
  - `G` - change number of ghosts
  - `C` - see the completion sequence
